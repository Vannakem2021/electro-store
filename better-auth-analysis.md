## Recommendation: Admin Plugin

### Why Admin Plugin is Perfect for Your E-commerce

1. **Exact Match for Requirements**
   - You need: Regular users and admin users
   - Admin plugin provides: Exactly that with `user` and `admin` roles

2. **E-commerce Specific Benefits**
   - **Customer Management**: Ban problematic customers, manage user accounts

   // Simple role check for admin features
   const canManageProducts = await authClient.admin.hasPermission({
     permissions: {
       product: ["create", "update", "delete"]
     }
   });
   ```

4. **Database Efficiency**
   - Minimal schema changes
   - No complex relationships
   - Better performance for single-tenant use

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Basic Setup**
   ```typescript
   // auth.ts
   export const auth = betterAuth({
     plugins: [
       admin({
         defaultRole: "user",
         adminRoles: ["admin"]
       })
     ]
   });
   ```

2. **Custom Permissions for E-commerce**
   ```typescript
   const statement = {
     product: ["create", "read", "update", "delete"],
     order: ["read", "update", "cancel"],
     user: ["read", "ban", "delete"]
   } as const;

   const ac = createAccessControl(statement);

   const user = ac.newRole({
     product: ["read"],
     order: ["read"] // Only their own orders
   });

   const admin = ac.newRole({
     product: ["create", "read", "update", "delete"],
     order: ["read", "update", "cancel"],
     user: ["read", "ban", "delete"]
   });
   ```

## Conclusion

The **Admin plugin** is the clear choice for your e-commerce application. It provides:

- ✅ Simple role-based access control (user/admin)
- ✅ Essential admin features (user management, session control)
- ✅ Customer support capabilities (user impersonation)
- ✅ Minimal complexity and maintenance overhead
- ✅ Perfect fit for single-tenant e-commerce platforms

The Organization plugin, while powerful, is designed for multi-tenant SaaS applications and would add unnecessary complexity to your e-commerce project without providing additional value for your use case.

## Next Steps

1. Install and configure the Admin plugin
2. Set up custom permissions for your e-commerce resources (products, orders, users)
3. Implement admin dashboard with proper permission checks
4. Add customer support features using impersonation capabilities
